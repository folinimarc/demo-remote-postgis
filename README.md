# demo-remote-postgis
Sometimes we want to quickly set up a public PostGIS database for testing or demonstration purposes. This repository provides a bootstrap script to set up a PostgreSQL + PostGIS database on a DigitalOcean droplet. It also includes an example of importing open geospatial data from Zürich, Switzerland, and running a sample spatial query.
